          <p>
            Basho is a Japanese word meaning “place.” It also carries the
            legacy of a poet who found depth in simplicity and meaning in
            fleeting moments. That idea lives on here, where clay is shaped
            slowly, guided by touch, patience, and intention. Every piece
            reflects a moment in time, embracing subtle imperfections and
            quiet rhythm, inviting a deeper connection between the maker,
            the object, and the space it belongs to.

            Rooted in the philosophy of Wabi-sabi, we embrace the beauty of imperfection.
            Like the cherry blossoms that bloom fleetingly, our creations remind us to cherish
            the present moment and find harmony in nature's simple forms.
